Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. 
A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in the graph) from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. 


Q Determine whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then prints the path. 
Following are the input and output of the required function.

Q What is Hamiltonian Cycle:
1. Hamiltonian Path: is a path in a graph that covers all the node.
2. if the last node and the src of the graph are connected, then it is known as
    Hamiltonian Cycle
3. We use backtracking to find them. 

4. Add the visited Visit all the neighbouring vertex, 

main(){
    ArrayList<Edge>[] graph; 

    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    findHamiltonian(graph, src, visited, orgsrc, psf);

}

void findHamiltonian(graph, src, visited, orgsrc, psf){

    if(visited.size()==graph.length-1){
        if(graph){

        }
    }
    visited.add(src);

    for(Edge e: graphp[src]){

        if(visited.contains(e.nbr)==false){

            findHamiltonian(graph, e.nbr, visited, orgsrc, psf);

        }
    }
}
